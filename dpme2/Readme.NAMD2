March 7, 1997
The original distribution had many compilation problems.
These included:
  _ shifting with ambiguous + or -.  (Compiler warning)
  _ unused variables
  _ no make definition for needed libraries in subdirectories

These warnings have been fixed and the 2 libraries and many .o files
have been merged into 1 library: libdpme2.a
