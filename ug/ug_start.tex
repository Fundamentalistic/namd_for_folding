\label{section:start}

\subsection{What is needed}

Before running \NAMD, explained in section \ref{section:run}, 
the following may be needed:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Because \NAMD\ depends on CHARMM or X-PLOR for providing input files, 
it is recommended that the user get and install CHARMM or X-PLOR.  
%See {\tt <URL>} for instructions.  
\item
The companion \MDSCOPE\ visualization program \VMD\ is not required.  
If desired, see {\tt http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/vmd} for instructions.  
\item
The initial structure of the molecular system is needed in the 
form of a PDB file.  
%(Should we cite a page number in X-PLOR manual?)  
\item
If \VMD\ is not being used as a GUI, then the user must provide 
a \NAMD\ configuration file. % (check this!)  
This is discussed in sections 
\ref{section:config}, \ref{section:files}, 
\ref{section:basic}, and \ref{section:add}.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\NAMD\ configuration file}
\label{section:config}

Besides these input and output files, \NAMD\ also uses 
a file referred to as the {\it configuration file\/}.  
This file specifies what dynamics options and values that 
\NAMD\ should use, such as the number of timesteps to perform, 
initial temperature, etc.  
The options and values in this file control how 
the system will be simulated.  
The format and options used in this configuration 
file are described in Section \ref{section:config}.  

A \NAMD\ configuration file contains a set of options and values.  
The options and values specified determine the exact behavior of
\NAMD, what features are active or inactive, how long the simulation
should continue, etc.  Section \ref{section:configsyntax} describes how
options are specified within a \NAMD\ configuration file.  Section
\ref{section:configparams} describes the various parameters that are
available and how to use them.  Section \ref{section:xplorequiv}
describes the relation between specific \NAMD\ and X-PLOR dynamics
options.  Several sample \NAMD\ configuration files are shown
in Section \ref{section:sample}


\subsubsection{Configuration parameter syntax}
\label{section:configsyntax}
Each line
in the configuration files consists of a $keyword$ identifying the option
being specified, and a $value$ which is a parameter to be used for this
option.  The keyword and value can be separated by only white space:
\begin{verbatim}
keyword            value
\end{verbatim}
or the keyword and value can be separated by an equal sign and white space:
\begin{verbatim}
keyword      =     value
\end{verbatim}
Blank lines in the configuration file are ignored.  Comments are prefaced by
a \verb!#! and may appear on the end of a line with actual values:
\begin{verbatim}
keyword            value          #  This is a comment
\end{verbatim}
or may be at the beginning of a line:
\begin{verbatim}
#  This entire line is a comment . . . 
\end{verbatim}
Some keywords require several lines of data.
These are generally implemented to either allow the data to be read from a file:
\begin{verbatim}
keyword            filename
\end{verbatim}
or to be included inline using Tcl-style braces:
\begin{verbatim}
keyword {
  lots of data
}
\end{verbatim}

The specification of the keywords is case insensitive 
so that any combination of 
upper and lower case letters will have the same meaning.  
Hence, {\tt DCDfile} and {\tt dcdfile} 
are equivalent.  The capitalization in the values, however, may be important.
Some values indicate file names, in which capitalization is critical.  
Other values such as {\tt on} or {\tt off} are case insensitive.

\subsubsection{Required \NAMD\ configuration parameters}
\label{section:configparams}

The following parameters are {\em required} for every
\NAMD\ simulation:

\begin{itemize}

\item
{\tt numsteps} (page \pageref{param:numsteps}),

\item
{\tt coordinates} (page \pageref{param:coordinates}),

\item
{\tt structure} (page \pageref{param:structure}),

\item
{\tt parameters} (page \pageref{param:parameters}),

\item
{\tt exclude} (page \pageref{param:exclude}), 

\item
{\tt outputname} (page \pageref{param:outputname}), 

\item
one of the following three:
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\tt temperature} (page \pageref{param:temperature}),

\item
{\tt velocities} (page \pageref{param:velocities}),

\item
{\tt binvelocities} (page \pageref{param:binvelocities}).
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\noindent These required parameters specify the most basic properties of
the simulation.  %  that is to be performed.
In addition, it is highly recommended that 
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\tt pairlistdist} be specified with a 
value at least one greater than the maximum of 
{\tt cutoff}, {\tt vdwcutoff}, and {\tt eleccutoff}, 
\item 
{\tt stepspercycle} be chosen so that the product of 
{\tt stepspercycle} and {\tt timestep} does not exceed 
$4.0$ unless {\tt rigidBonds all} is specified, 
in which case the upper limit is perhaps doubled.  
\end{itemize}
