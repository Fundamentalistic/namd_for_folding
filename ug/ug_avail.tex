\section{\NAMD\ Availability and Installation}
\label{section:avail}

\NAMD\ is distributed freely for non-profit use.
\NAMD\ \NAMDVER\ is based on the Charm messaging system and the
Converse communication layer ({\tt http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/})
which have been ported to a wide variety of parallel platforms.
This section describes how to obtain and install \NAMD\ \NAMDVER.

\subsection{How to obtain \NAMD}

\NAMD\ may be downloaded from {\tt http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/}.
You will be required to provide minimal registration information and
agree to a license before receiving access to the software.
Both source and binary distributions are available.

\subsection{Platforms on which \NAMD\ will currently run}
\NAMD\ should be portable to any parallel platform with a
modern C++ compiler to which Charm and Converse have been ported.
Precompiled \NAMD\ \NAMDVER\ binaries are available for the following platforms:  
\begin{itemize}
\item Windows (NT, etc.) on Intel processors 
\item AIX on RS/6000 processors 
\item HP-UX on PA-RISC processors 
\item Linux on Intel and Alpha processors 
\item Solaris on Sparc processors 
\item Tru64 Unix on Alpha processors 
\item Cray T3E 
\item IBM RS/6000 SP 
\item SGI Origin 2000 (with and without MPI) 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Compiling \NAMD}

We provide complete and optimized binaries for all
platforms to which NAMD has been ported.
It should not be necessary for you to compile
NAMD unless you wish to add or modify features.

Directions for compiling NAMD are contained in the release notes,
which are available from the NAMD web site
{\tt http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/}
and are included in all distributions.

\subsection{Documentation}

All available \NAMD\ documentation is available for download without
registration via the \NAMD\ web site
{\tt http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/}.
