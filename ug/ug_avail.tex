\section{\NAMD\ Availability and Installation}
\label{section:avail}

\NAMD\ is distributed freely for non-profit use.
\NAMD\ \NAMDVER\ is based on the Charm messaging system and the
Converse communication layer ({\tt http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/})
which have been ported to a wide variety of parallel platforms.
This section describes how to obtain and install \NAMD\ \NAMDVER.

\subsection{How to obtain \NAMD}

\NAMD\ may be downloaded from {\tt http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/}.
You will be required to provide minimal registration information and
agree to a license before receiving access to the software.
Pre-compiled binaries are available for most architectures to which
\NAMD\ has been ported.

\subsection{Platforms on which \NAMD\ will currently run}
\NAMD\ \NAMDVER\ should be portable to any parallel platform with a
modern C++ compiler to which Charm and Converse have been ported.
Some minor tuning of system parameters or compiler flags 
may be required.
\NAMD\ \NAMDVER\ has been compiled and tested on the following platforms:  
\begin{itemize}
\item Intel PC's (Linux)
\item HP PA-RISC workstations
\item Sun UltraSparc workstations
\item ACSI Red
\item IBM SP3
\item Cray T3D and T3E
\item SGI Origin 2000, Origin 200, and Onyx 2
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Compiling \NAMD}

To compile \NAMD\ for a particular machine, follow these steps:  

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Obtain the latest release of Charm from {\tt http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/}
and compile it for the platforms you with to use.
\item
Edit {\tt Make.charm} so that the {\tt CHARMBASE} variable
points to the top directory of your Charm installation.
\item 
The {\tt arch} directory contains files of the form {\tt Makearch.<architecture>}.
Find the file which is closest to the platform you wish to compile for and
edit it.  You may need to alter some of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt CXX} - C++ compiler
\item {\tt CXXOPTS} - C++ compiler options
\item {\tt CC} - C compiler
\item {\tt COPTS} - C compiler options
\item {\tt CHARMARCH} - Charm architecture name
\item {\tt TCL...} - definitions for Tcl installation (optional)
\item {\tt MDCOMM...} - definitions for MDComm installation (very optional)
\end{itemize}
\item
In the main directory run {\tt ../config <architecture>}
which will create a new build subdirectory {\tt <architecture>}.
You only need to repeat this step if you add new source files.
\item 
Change to this new directory and type {\tt make}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Documentation}

All available \NAMD\ documentation is available for download without
registration via the \NAMD\ web site
{\tt http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/}.

%The directory {\tt doc} contains three documents:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item the \UG\ ({\tt ug.ps}, this document) describes how to use \NAMD, 
%\item the \PG\ ({\tt pg.ps}) provides a complete description of \NAMD\ and 
%  its implementation, 
%\item {\tt configsheet.ps} provides a one page summary of the 
%  configuration options for \NAMD.  
%\end{itemize}
