\section{\NAMD\ Availability and Installation}
\label{section:avail}

\NAMD\ is distributed freely for non-profit use.
\NAMD\ \NAMDVER\ is based on the Charm++ messaging system and the
Converse communication layer ({\tt http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/})
which have been ported to a wide variety of parallel platforms.
This section describes how to obtain and install \NAMD\ \NAMDVER.

\subsection{How to obtain \NAMD}

\NAMD\ may be downloaded from {\tt http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/}.
You will be required to provide minimal registration information and
agree to a license before receiving access to the software.
Both source and binary distributions are available.

\subsection{Platforms on which \NAMD\ will currently run}
\NAMD\ should be portable to any parallel platform with a
modern C++ compiler to which Charm and Converse have been ported.
Precompiled \NAMD\ \NAMDVER\ binaries are available for the following platforms:  
\begin{itemize}
\item Windows (NT, etc.) on x86 processors 
\item Mac OS X (also called Darwin) on PowerPC and Intel processors
\item AIX on POWER processors (with and without MPI)
\item Linux on x86, x86-64 (AMD64/EMT64) and Itanium (IA64) processors 
\item Scyld Beowulf on x86 processors 
\item Clustermatic 4/5 on x86 processors 
\item Solaris on Sparc processors (with and without MPI)
\item Tru64 Unix on Alpha processors (with and without MPI)
\item Compaq AlphaServer SC (using the Quadrics Elan library)
\item SGI Origin 2000 (with and without MPI) 
\item SGI Altix (with MPI)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Compiling \NAMD}

We provide complete and optimized binaries for all
platforms to which NAMD has been ported.
It should not be necessary for you to compile
NAMD unless you wish to add or modify features
or to improve performance by using an MPI library
that takes advantage of special networking hardware.

Directions for compiling NAMD are contained in the release notes,
which are available from the NAMD web site
{\tt http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/}
and are included in all distributions.

\subsection{Documentation}

All available \NAMD\ documentation is available for download without
registration via the \NAMD\ web site
{\tt http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/}.
