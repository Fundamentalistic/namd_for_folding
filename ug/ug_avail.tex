\section{\NAMD\ Availability and Installation}
\label{section:avail}

\NAMD\ is distributed freely for non-profit use.
\NAMD\ \NAMDVER\ is based on the Charm++ messaging system and the
Converse communication layer ({\tt http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/})
which have been ported to a wide variety of parallel platforms.
This section describes how to obtain and install \NAMD\ \NAMDVER.

\subsection{How to obtain \NAMD}

\NAMD\ may be downloaded from {\tt http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/}.
You will be required to provide minimal registration information and
agree to a license before receiving access to the software.
Both source and binary distributions are available.

\subsection{Platforms on which \NAMD\ will currently run}
\NAMD\ should be portable to any parallel platform with a
modern C++ compiler to which Charm and Converse have been ported.
Precompiled \NAMD\ \NAMDVER\ binaries are available for
download for the following platforms:  

\begin{itemize}
\item Windows (XP, etc.) on x86 processors
\item Mac OS X on PowerPC and Intel processors
\item Linux on x86, x86-64, and Itanium processors
\item SGI Altix (with MPI)
\item AIX on POWER processors (with and without MPI)
\item Solaris on Sparc and x86-64 processors
\end{itemize}

\NAMD\ has been ported to the Cray XT for both Catamount
and compute-node Linux, but the lack of dynamic linking on this platform
often results in the need to recompile \NAMD\ after system upgrades so we are
unable to distribute useful binaries.

\NAMD\ has been ported to the IBM Blue Gene L and P, but we do
not have regular access to these machines.  Binaries provided by
IBM may be available for download from our website.

\subsection{Compiling \NAMD}

We provide complete and optimized binaries for all
platforms to which NAMD has been ported.
It should not be necessary for you to compile
NAMD unless you wish to add or modify features
or to improve performance by using an MPI library
that takes advantage of special networking hardware.

Directions for compiling NAMD are contained in the release notes,
which are available from the NAMD web site
{\tt http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/}
and are included in all distributions.

\subsection{Documentation}

All available \NAMD\ documentation is available for download without
registration via the \NAMD\ web site
{\tt http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/}.
