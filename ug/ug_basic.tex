\subsection{Non-bonded interaction parameters and computations}
\label{section:electdesc}

\NAMD\ has a number of options that control the way that non-bonded
interactions are calculated.  These options are interrelated and
can be quite confusing, so this section attempts to explain the
behavior of the non-bonded interactions and how to use these
parameters.

\subsubsection{Non-bonded van der Waals interactions}
The simplest non-bonded 
interaction is the van der Waals interaction.  In 
\NAMD, van der Waals interactions are always truncated at the 
cutoff distance, specified by {\tt cutoff}.  
The main option that effects van der Waals interactions
is the {\tt switching} parameter.  With this option set to {\tt on},
a smooth switching function will be used to truncate the
van der Waals potential energy smoothly at the cutoff distance.  
A graph of the van der Waals 
potential with this switching function is shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:switching}.  If {\tt switching} is set to {\tt off}, the 
van der Waals energy is just abruptly truncated at the cutoff 
distance, so that energy may not be conserved.  

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \center{\includegraphics{figures/switching}}
  \caption[Graph of van der Waals potential with and without switching]
  {\small Graph of van der Waals potential with and without the
  application of the switching function.  With the switching function
  active, the potential is smoothly reduced to 0 at the cutoff distance.
  Without the switching function, there is a discontinuity where the
  potential is truncated.}
  \label{fig:switching}
\end{figure}

The details of the switching function are given in the \PG.
The switching function used is based on the X-PLOR switching
function.  The parameter {\tt switchdist} specifies the distance
at which the switching function should start taking effect to
bring the van der Waals potential to 0 smoothly at the cutoff distance.  
Thus, the value of {\tt switchdist} must always be less than that 
of {\tt cutoff}.


\subsubsection{Non-bonded electrostatic interactions}
The handling of electrostatics is slightly
more complicated due to the incorporation of multiple timestepping for full
electrostatic interactions.  There are two cases to consider, one where
full electrostatics is employed and the other where electrostatics
are truncated at a given distance.
\prettypar
First let us consider the latter case, where electrostatics are truncated at
the cutoff distance.  Using this scheme, all electrostatic interactions
beyond a specified distance are ignored, or assumed to be zero.  If
{\tt switching} is set to {\tt on}, rather than having a discontinuity
in the potential
at the cutoff distance, a shifting function is applied to the electrostatic
potential as shown in Figure \ref{fig:shifting}.  As this figure shows, the
shifting function shifts the entire potential curve so that the curve
intersects the x-axis at the cutoff distance.  This shifting function
is fully described in the \PG\ and is based on the
shifting function used by X-PLOR.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \center{\includegraphics{figures/shifting}}
  \caption[Graph of electrostatic potential with and without shifting function]
  {\small Graph showing an electrostatic potential with and without the
  application of the shifting function.}
  \label{fig:shifting}
\end{figure}

Next, consider the case where full electrostatics are calculated.  In this
case, the electrostatic interactions are not truncated at any distance.  In
this scheme, the {\tt cutoff} parameter has a slightly different meaning
for the electrostatic interactions --- it represents
the {\it local interaction distance\/}, or distance within which electrostatic
pairs will be directly calculated every timestep.  Outside of this distance,
interactions will be calculated only periodically.  These forces
will be applied using a multiple timestep integration scheme as described in
Section \ref{section:fmadesc}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \center{\includegraphics{figures/fmaOn}}
  \caption[Graph of electrostatic split between short and long range forces]
  {\small Graph showing an electrostatic potential 
  when full electrostatics are used within \NAMD, 
  with one curve portion calculated directly 
  and the other calculated using DPMTA.}
  \label{fig:fmaOn}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Nonbonded interaction distance-testing}
The last critical parameter for non-bonded
interaction calculations is the parameter {\tt pairlistdist}.  To reduce the
cost of performing the non-bonded interactions, \NAMD\ 1.X used a {\it non-bonded
pair list} which contained all pairs of atoms for which
non-bonded interactions
should be calculated.  Performing the search for pairs of atoms that
should have their interactions calculated is an expensive operation.  Thus,
the pair list is only calculated periodically, once per cycle.   Unfortunately,
pairs of atoms move relative to each other during the steps between preparation
of the pair list.  Because of this, if the pair list were built to include
only
those pairs of atoms that are within the cutoff distance
when the list is generated, it would
be possible 
for atoms to drift closer together
than the cutoff distance during subsequent timesteps and yet not
have their non-bonded interactions calculated.  
\prettypar
Let us consider a concrete example to better understand this.  Assume that the
pairlist is built once every ten timesteps and that the cutoff
distance is 8.0 \AA.  Consider a pair
of atoms A and B that are 8.1 \AA\ apart when the pairlist is built.
If the pair list
includes only those atoms within the cutoff distance, this pair would not
be included in the list.  Now assume that after five timesteps, atoms
A and B have moved to only 7.9 \AA\ apart.  A and B are now within the
cutoff distance of each other, and should have their
non-bonded interactions calculated.
However, because the non-bonded interactions are based solely on the pair list
and the pair list will not be rebuilt for another five timesteps, this pair
will be ignored for five timesteps causing energy not to be conserved 
within the system.  
\prettypar
To avoid this problem, the parameter {\tt pairlistdist} allowed the user
to specify a distance greater than the {\tt cutoff} distance for pairs
to be included in the pair list, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:pairlistdist}.
Pairs that are included in the pair list but are outside the cutoff distance
are simply ignored.  So in the above example, if the {\tt pairlistdist}
were set to $10.0$ \AA, then 
the atom pair A and B would be included in the pair list, even though
the pair would initially be ignored because they are further apart than
the cutoff distance.  As the pair moved closer and entered the cutoff
distance, because the pair was already in the pair list, the non-bonded
interactions would immediately be calculated and energy conservation
would be preserved.  The value of {\tt pairlistdist} should be chosen
such that no atom pair moves more than 
$\mbox{{\tt pairlistdist}}-\mbox{{\tt cutoff}}$ 
in one cycle.  This will insure energy conservation.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \center{\includegraphics{figures/pairlistdist}}
  \caption[Example of cutoff and pairlist distance uses]
  {{\small Depiction of the difference between the cutoff distance and the
  pair list distance.  The pair list distance specifies a sphere that is
  slightly larger than that of the cutoff so that pairs are allowed to
  move in and out of the cutoff distance without causing energy conservation
  to be disturbed.}}
  \label{fig:pairlistdist}
\end{figure}

NAMD 2.X eliminated the explicit use of pairlists in order to reduce memory usage in light of equally efficient distance-testing algorithms.
Specifically, it was realized that building a pairlist on top of the existing spatial decomposition was only marginally more efficient than actually testing atom distances at every timestep given efficient methods for dealing with nonbonded exclusions.
The {\tt pairlistdist} parameter now serves the same function, but is instead used to determine the minimum patch size.
Unless the {\tt splitPatch} parameter is explicitly set to {\tt position}, hydrogen atoms will be placed on the same patch as the ``mother atom'' to which they are bonded.
These {\em hydrogen groups} are then distance tested against each other using only a cutoff increased by the the value of the {\tt hgroupCutoff} parameter.
The size of the patches is also increased by this amount.
\NAMD\ functions correctly even if a hydrogen atom and its mother atom are separated by more than half of {\tt hgroupCutoff} by breaking that group into its individual atoms for distance testing.
Warning messages are printed if an atom moves outside of a safe zone surrounding the patch to which it is assigned, indicating that {\tt pairlistdist} should be increased in order for forces to be calculated correctly and energy to be conserved.

\subsection{Full electrostatic integration}
\label{section:fmadesc}

To further reduce the cost of computing full electrostatics, 
\NAMD\ uses a multiple timestepping integration scheme.  In this scheme, 
the total force acting on each atom is broken into two pieces, a quickly varying local 
component and a slower long range component.  
The local force component is defined in terms of a {\it splitting function}.  The local force component consists of all bonded and van der Waals interactions
as well as that portion of electrostatic interactions for pairs that are separated by less than the local interaction distance determined by the splitting function.  
The long range component consists only of 
electrostatic interactions outside of the local interaction distance.
Since the long range forces are slowly varying, they are not evaluated
every timestep.  Instead, they are evaluated every $k$ timesteps, and
each set of $k$ timesteps is referred to as a $cycle$.
The value of $k$ is specified by the \NAMD\ parameter
{\tt stepspercycle}.  
An impulse of $k$ times the long range force is applied to the system
every $k$ timesteps (i.e., the r-RESPA integrator is used).
For appropriate values of $k$,
it is believed that the error introduced by this infrequent evaluation
is modest compared to the error already incurred by the use of the numerical
(Verlet) integrator.  
%The performance of \NAMD\ with the use of DPMTA to provide 
%full electrostatics approximately doubles the 
%run time of a simulation as compared to \NAMD\ with an 
%$8.0$ \AA\ electrostatic cutoff.  
Improved methods for incorporating these long range forces
are currently being investigated, 
with the intention of improving accuracy as well as 
reducing the frequency of long range force evaluations.  
\prettypar
In the scheme described above, the van der Waals forces are still 
truncated at the local interaction distance.  
Thus, the van der Waals cutoff distance 
forms a lower limit to the local interaction distance.  While this is
believed to be sufficient, there are investigations underway to remove
this limitation and provide full van der Waals calculations in 
${\mathcal O}(N)$ time as well.

{{\tt none}, {\tt 1-2}, {\tt 1-3}, {\tt 1-4}, or {\tt scaled1-4}}
{\label{param:exclude}
%% This parameter is {\it required\/} for every simulation.
This parameter specifies which pairs of bonded atoms should
be excluded from non-bonded
interactions.  With the value of {\tt none}, no bonded pairs of atoms 
will be excluded.  With the value of {\tt 1-2}, all atom pairs that
are directly connected via a linear bond will be excluded.  With the
value of {\tt 1-3}, all {\tt 1-2} pairs will be excluded along with
all pairs of atoms that are bonded to a common
third atom (i.e., if atom A is bonded to atom B and atom B is bonded
to atom C, then the atom pair A-C would be excluded).
With the value of {\tt 1-4}, all {\tt 1-3} pairs will be excluded along
with all pairs connected by a set of two bonds (i.e., if atom A is bonded
to atom B, and atom B is bonded to atom C, and atom C is bonded to
atom D, then the atom pair A-D would be excluded).  With the value
of {\tt scaled1-4}, all {\tt 1-3} pairs are excluded and all pairs
that match the {\tt 1-4} criteria are modified.  The electrostatic

seed will be output during the simulation startup so that
its value is known and can be reused for subsequent simulations.

\subsubsection{DPMTA parameters}

These parameters control the options to DPMTA, an algorithm
used to provide full electrostatic interactions.  DPMTA is a
modified version of the FMA (Fast Multipole Algorithm) and, 
unfortunately, most of the parameters still refer to FMA
rather than DPMTA for historical reasons.  Don't be confused!
\prettypar
For a further description of how exactly full electrostatics
are incorporated into \NAMD, see Section \ref{section:fmadesc}.
For a greater level of detail about DPMTA and the specific

set to a multiple of 4.  
This feature offers substantial benefits only for values 
of {\tt FMAMp} of 8 or greater.  This feature will substantially 
increase the amount of memory used by DPMTA.}

\subsubsection{PME parameters}

PME stands for Particle Mesh Ewald and is an efficient
full electrostatics method for use with periodic boundary conditions.
None of the parameters should affect energy conservation, although they may affect the accuracy of the results and momentum conservation.

\begin{itemize}

your parallel performance is poor when PME is used.}

\item
\NAMDCONFWDEF{useDPME}{Use old DPME code?}{{\tt yes} or {\tt no}}{{\tt no}}
{Switches to old DPME implementation of particle mesh Ewald.
The new code is faster and allows non-orthogonal cells so you
probably just want to leave this option turned off.  If you set
{\tt cellOrigin} to something other than $(0,0,0)$ the energy may differ
slightly between the old and new implementations.
}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Full direct parameters}

The direct computation of electrostatics 
is not intended to be used during 
real calculations, but rather as a testing or 
comparison measure.  Because of the ${\mathcal O}(N^2)$ 
computational complexity for performing 
direct calculations, this is {\it much} 
slower than using DPMTA or PME to compute full 
electrostatics for large systems.
In the case of periodic boundary conditions,
the nearest image convention is used rather than a
full Ewald sum.

\subsubsection{Multiple timestep parameters}

One of the areas of current research being studied using \NAMD\ is the
exploration of better methods for performing multiple timestep integration.
Currently the only available method is the impulse-based Verlet-I or r-RESPA
method which is stable for timesteps up to 4~fs for long-range electrostatic
forces, 2~fs for short-range nonbonded forces, and 1~fs for bonded forces
Setting {\tt rigid all} (i.e., using SHAKE) increases these timesteps to
6~fs, 2~fs, and 2~fs respectively but eliminates bond motion for hydrogen.
The mollified impulse method (MOLLY) reduces the resonance which limits
the timesteps and thus increases these timesteps to 6~fs, 2~fs, and 1~fs
while retaining all bond motion.

\begin{itemize}

\item
\NAMDCONFWDEF{fullElectFrequency}{number of timesteps between full electrostatic evaluations}{positive integer factor of {\tt stepspercycle}}{{\tt nonbondedFreq}}
{This parameter specifies the number of timesteps between each full electrostatics evaluation.
It is recommended that {\tt fullElectFrequency} be chosen so that 
the product of {\tt fullElectFrequency} and {\tt timestep} does 
not exceed $4.0$ unless {\tt rigidBonds all} or {\tt molly on} is specified, 
in which case the upper limit is perhaps doubled.}

\item
\NAMDCONFWDEF{nonbondedFreq}{timesteps between nonbonded evaluation}{positive integer factor of {\tt fullElectFrequency}}{1}
{This parameter specifies how often short-range nonbonded interactions should be calculated.  Setting {\tt nonbondedFreq} between 1 and {\tt fullElectFrequency} allows triple timestepping where, for example, one could evaluate bonded forces every 1 fs, short-range nonbonded forces every 2 fs, and long-range electrostatics every 4 fs.} 

\item
\NAMDCONFWDEF{MTSAlgorithm}{MTS algorithm to be used}{{\tt impulse/verletI} or {\tt constant/naive}}{{\tt impulse}}
{Specifies the multiple timestep algorithm used to integrate the 
long and short range forces.  {\tt impulse/verletI} is the same as r-RESPA.
{\tt constant/naive} is the stale force extrapolation method.}


\item
\NAMDCONFWDEF{longSplitting}{how should long and short range forces be split?}{{\tt xplor}, {\tt c1}}{{\tt c1}}
{Specifies the method used to split electrostatic forces between long 
and short range potentials.  
The {\tt xplor} option uses the X-PLOR shifting function, 
and the {\tt c1} splitting uses 
the following $C^1$ continuous shifting 
function \mycite{Humphreys \ETAL}{HUMP94}:  
\begin{list}{}{}
\item
$SW(r_{ij}) = 0$ if $|{{\vec{r}}_{ij}}| > R_{\mathit off}$
\item
$SW(r_{ij}) = 1$ if $|{{\vec{r}}_{ij}}| \leq R_{\mathit on}$
\item
% $SW(r_{ij}) = \frac{ {\left({R_{\mathit off}}^2 - {r_{ij}}^2\right)}^2
% \left({R_{\mathit off}}^2 + 2{r_{ij}}^2 - 3{R_{\mathit on}}^2\right)}
% {{\left({R_{\mathit off}}^2 - {R_{\mathit on}}^2\right)}^3}$
if $R_{\mathit off} > |{{\vec{r}}_{ij}}| \geq R_{\mathit on}$
\end{list}
}
where
\begin{list}{}{}
\item
$R_{\mathit on}$ is a constant defined using the configuration value 
{\tt switchdist} 
\item
$R_{\mathit off}$ is specified using the configuration value {\tt cutoff}
\end{list}

\item
\NAMDCONFWDEF{molly}{use mollified impulse method (MOLLY)?}
{{\tt on} or {\tt off}}{{\tt off}}
{
This method eliminates the components of the long range electrostatic
forces which contribute to resonance along bonds to hydrogen atoms,
allowing a fullElectFrequency of 6 (vs.\ 4) with a 1~fs timestep
without using {\tt rigidBonds all}.  You may use {\tt rigidBonds water} but
using {\tt rigidBonds all} with MOLLY makes no sense since the degrees of
freedom which MOLLY protects from resonance are already frozen.

\item
\NAMDCONFWDEF{mollyTolerance}{allowable error for MOLLY}
{positive decimal}{0.00001}
{
Convergence criterion for MOLLY algorithm.

\item
